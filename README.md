### Description

Hexlet Code is a collection of 5 math-related games designed to challenge and improve your arithmetic skills. The games include:

- Checking if a number is prime
- Inserting a number into an arithmetic progression
- Providing the result of a calculation (multiplication, addition, subtraction)
- Answering if a number is even
- Finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers

### Games
